# This requires recipes: 'karaf'

# As we cannot relay on :delayed notification for Karaf restart in this Cookbook
# we have to use a trick, where we create temporary file during Karaf deployment
# After that we execute this recipe. If the temporary file exists, then we
# restart Karaf service, to trigger bundle/config deployment.
